# Flow settings:
# By default, the reserved memory (memcap) for flows is 32MB. This is the limit
# for flow allocation inside the engine. You can change this value to allow
# more memory usage for flows.
# The hash-size determines the size of the hash used to identify flows inside
# the engine, and by default the value is 65536.
# At startup, the engine can preallocate a number of flows, to get better
# performance. The number of flows preallocated is 10000 by default.
# emergency-recovery is the percentage of flows that the engine needs to
# prune before clearing the emergency state. The emergency state is activated
# when the memcap limit is reached, allowing new flows to be created, but
# pruning them with the emergency timeouts (they are defined below).
# If the memcap is reached, the engine will try to prune flows
# with the default timeouts. If it doesn't find a flow to prune, it will set
# the emergency bit and it will try again with more aggressive timeouts.
# If that doesn't work, then it will try to kill the oldest flows using
# last time seen flows.
# The memcap can be specified in kb, mb, gb.  Just a number indicates it's
# in bytes.
# The memcap-policy can be "drop-packet", "pass-packet", "reject" or "ignore"
# (which is the default).

# Specific timeouts for flows. Here you can specify the timeouts that the
# active flows will wait to transit from the current state to another, on each
# protocol. The value of "new" determines the seconds to wait after a handshake or
# stream startup before the engine frees the data of that flow it doesn't
# change the state to established (usually if we don't receive more packets
# of that flow). The value of "established" is the amount of
# seconds that the engine will wait to free the flow if that time elapses
# without receiving new packets or closing the connection. "closed" is the
# amount of time to wait after a flow is closed (usually zero). "bypassed"
# timeout controls locally bypassed flows. For these flows we don't do any other
# tracking. If no packets have been seen after this timeout, the flow is discarded.
#
# There's an emergency mode that will become active under attack circumstances,
# making the engine to check flow status faster. This configuration variables

## Performance tuning and profiling
##

# The detection engine builds internal groups of signatures. The engine
# allows us to specify the profile to use for them, to manage memory in an
# efficient way keeping good performance. For the profile keyword you
# can use the words "low", "medium", "high" or "custom". If you use custom,
# make sure to define the values in the "custom-values" section.
# Usually you would prefer medium/high/low.
#
# "sgh mpm-context", indicates how the staging should allot mpm contexts for
# the signature groups.  "single" indicates the use of a single context for
# all the signature group heads.  "full" indicates a mpm-context for each
# group head.  "auto" lets the engine decide the distribution of contexts
# based on the information the engine gathers on the patterns from each
# group head.
#
# The option inspection-recursion-limit is used to limit the recursive calls
# in the content inspection code.  For certain payload-sig combinations, we
# might end up taking too much time in the content inspection code.
# If the argument specified is 0, the engine uses an internally defined
# default limit.  When a value is not specified, there are no limits on the recursion.
